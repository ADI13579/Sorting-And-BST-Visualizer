# Sorting and Binary Tree Visualizer

An application that allows us to visualize sorting algorithms such as
bubble,selection,insertion and merge sort with animations. Also the
project helps to visualize Binary Search Tree.This project is based on
[openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) and C++.
